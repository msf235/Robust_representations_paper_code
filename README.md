# Robust_representations_paper_code
Code to generate the figures for "Robust representations learned in RNNs through implicit balance of expansion and compression"

The script figures_for_manuscript.py contains code to call plotting functions that generate the figures in the paper. This script primarily calls plots.py, which contains the code for generating the figures.

The error bars for plots is generated by a custom modification made to the seaborn plotting library. This modification is not currently available, but will be made available shortly. In the meantime, error bars are 95% confidence intervals.

When the neural networks are trained, the weights through training are saved in a directory, and this directory location is noted in the table output/output_table.csv, which maps the directory to the set of parameters used to train the model (those passed to initialize_and_train.initialize_and_train). This mapping of parameters and save locations is handled by model_output_manager.py. The next time initialize_and_train.initialize_and_train is called, it will automatically check for a previous run that matches that set of parameters, and load the model if it finds it. To disable this behavior, either keep the directory output/ empty, or set rerun=True in the parameters passed to initialize_and_train.initialize_and_train.
